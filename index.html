        <h3>Quick rap about myself</h3>

        <p>I am 33 years old and orginally from Oklahoma City; I recently moved to Plano, Texas about almost two years ago. I grew up doing just about everything from sports, martial arts, acting, and other things. I have always been fascinated with tech
            in a multitude of ways with coding being one of them. Ever since I first saw a film with someone "coding" in it I have always thought it was so cool. I loved sports so much though my focus remained there until I became an adult in the regular
            workforce; I hopped around from job to job not really liking any of them. My cousin who works in IT introduced me to coding through a free coding app which I had a lot of fun with but still did not see myself doing it as a career. Fast forward
            to the start of the terror named Covid and I finally had the time to sit down and focus on what my career would actually be. Once again Software Engineering stepped up to the stage and now here we are, soon to be Thinkful grad...
        </p>
        <p>Since I was a kid I have always played some sort of team sport and it instilled the appreciation and want to always have that in my life. One mind is good, but a group of bright minds can move mountains. You would get a great team player who will
            put the time and effort in a key piece to the success of team and missions. Please reach out if that is something you are looking for. Thank you for your eyes and time, talk to you soon.
